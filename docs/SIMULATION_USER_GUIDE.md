   - Try incognito/private mode

### Can't Save Simulation

**Problem**: "Failed to save simulation" error

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify you're logged in (check top-right corner)
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check localStorage quota (not full)
5. Try a different browser

💾 **Note**: Simulations save locally even if server fails

### Performance Slow

**Problem**: Lag, stuttering, or slow response

**Solutions**:
1. Close other browser tabs
2. Close unused applications
3. Reduce graphics quality:
   - Hide the 3D data viewer
   - Use simple camera views
   - Avoid frequent zoom/pan

4. Clear simulation history:
   - Delete old simulations
   - Keep only last 10-20

5. Update your browser to the latest version

### Results Don't Make Sense

**Problem**: Unexpected scores or outcomes

**Remember**:
- Market volatility adds randomness (0-50%)
- Results vary between runs
- Random factors simulate real-world uncertainty
- Try running the same setup multiple times
- Average results across 3-5 runs for patterns
